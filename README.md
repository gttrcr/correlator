Each release folder also contains some example datasets so you can immediately test the correct functioning of the program on real data: in case of errors, any [issue](https://github.com/gttrcr/correlator/issues) is welcome :wink:.

## Introduction and motivation
Many datasets are composed of real scalar functions (scalar function for short) or are amenable to scalar functions. In the most general case, a scalar function is a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$. Therefore an input csv file with $n+1$ columns is interpreted as a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$.

Just add the csv files you want to analyze inside the executable folder and the program will start processing. Every execution of ```correlator``` do the following:
1. Look for every csv file in the execution folder.
2. Compute the best polynomial fit for every pair of input (on the y axis) and for every file (x with respect to y).
3. Compute fft for every input file.
4. Compute peaks in every fft.
5. Compute the best polynomial fit for the migration of peaks at point 4.

The results are placed inside the ```out_correlator``` default folder (or the output folder you decide from cli). The folder contains many files (sometimes hundreds :wink:). But the filename structure is pretty straightforward. Polyfit folder contains output of the polynomial fitting, FFT contains output of FFT, and so on. Every file is contained inside the metadata.json file.

## Dev section (linux only)
Since it's easier to compile for windows on linux than to compile on windows for linux I unquestionably established that all development will take place on linux so the scripts placed here and there in the repo are all ```.sh``` (that's not true: if you have proposals to implement a development process directly for windows leave feedback via [issue](https://github.com/gttrcr/correlator/issues) :face_in_clouds:).

There are two ```.sh``` scripts.
* ```./setup.sh platform``` sets up the system, update and init all submodules, configure the platform and the compiler. ```platform``` is:
  * ```win32``` for windows 32 bits
  * ```win64``` for windows 64 bits
  * ```linux```for linux
* ```./release.sh``` releases every supported platform and produces the zip files that will be distributed.
